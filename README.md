Description:
The goal of Task-1 was to create a simple yet functional web page that fetches real-time data from a public API such as weather, news, or cryptocurrency. This task tested our understanding of asynchronous programming using JavaScript, API handling via fetch() or axios, and responsive design. The final product was a mobile-friendly, dynamic webpage that fetches and displays data like city-based weather using OpenWeather API. It includes a user input field, search functionality, and auto-refresh. The frontend was styled using HTML and CSS to ensure clarity and readability, and the app updates dynamically without needing to reload the page.
